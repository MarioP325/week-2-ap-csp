# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Mario"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_number = 8

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(first_name + favorite_color)

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
num0=16
num1=10
print(num0 + num1)
#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
question=input("What number are you thinking of")
question1=input("what color do you like")
print("You are thinking of the number", question + " and you like the color", question1)



# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
print("In 10 years you will be", num1 + num0)
num3= int(input("number 3 please"))
num4= int(input("number 4 please"))
print(num3+num4)
